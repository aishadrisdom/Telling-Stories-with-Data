# About me
Hi! I am Aisha Drisdom, I am an undergrad studying at Carnegie Mellon. I am interested in learning about variety topics that will assist me to become a *data analyst* or any career that involves the use of data. So, I'm interested in knowing more about the importance of telling stories with data visualizations. I am also intertesed in using data to fight issues like social justice and climate change.

- improving more Tableau skills
- learning about more additional websites that can produce data visualizations
- other additonial technical skills like coding that are criitcal for producing data visualizations
- ability to critique variety of data visualizations
